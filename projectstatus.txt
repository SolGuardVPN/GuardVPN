Modules — Status

On-chain program: completed — dvpn deployed to Testnet (register_provider/register_node/open_session/close_session/claim_payout implemented).
IDL fixes: completed — dvpn.json normalized for client use.
PDA search & diagnostics: completed — scripts/compute_* and find_node_pda.js added and used.
MVP client scripts: completed — mvp.ts creates provider + node (uses node id 0).
Fetch / scan scripts: completed — fetch_node.js, fetch_provider_and_sessions.js, scan_sessions.js.
Session creation (escrow): completed — manual and server-backed session creation tested; session PDA created and decoded.
Node daemon (poller): completed — node_daemon.js polls Node + Provider.
Node daemon HTTP server: completed — node_daemon_server.js exposes endpoints and session creation.
WireGuard auth endpoint: completed — /session/auth verifies user signature, allocates IP, provisions peer.
WireGuard interface setup: completed (manual steps run) — wireguard-go interface brought up (utun20) and configured.
Sudoers rule for wg: completed — restricted fixed-dvpn-wg created to allow wg via sudo.
State persistence for peers: completed — peers.json stores mappings of session → client WG pubkey + IP.
Auto peer removal at expiry: pending — not implemented (suggest implementing scheduled cleanup).
WireGuard peer provisioning hardening: processing — basic checks and sudo usage added; further hardening pending.
Staking / slashing: pending — not implemented.
Reputation system: pending — not implemented.
Usage-based billing (receipts/hash-chain): pending — not implemented.
Indexer / Electron client (discovery UI): pending — only lightweight scripts exist; full indexer & UI pending.
Cleanup & documentation: pending — many helper scripts exist; repo cleanup and README needed.
If you want, I can immediately (choose one):

Implement auto peer removal at session expiry (daemon timer + wg remove + state cleanup).
Add a README and cleanup scripts into scripts/dev/.
Start the Electron client / indexer plan (scaffold).
